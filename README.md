## Overview

<a href="#">Moom</a> delivers efficient window management through an interface designed for both simplicity and depth. The application serves professionals, multitaskers, and anyone who works with multiple windows regularly.

The <a href="#">layout snapshots</a> save complete window arrangements for restoration. Capture current desktop state and restore it anytime with single action.

<a href="#">Application-specific layouts</a> apply different arrangements based on active app. Automatically position windows appropriately for different work contexts.

<a href="#">Chained actions</a> combine multiple operations into single shortcut. Create complex positioning sequences that execute with one keystroke.

The <a href="#">mouse controls</a> offer alternative to keyboard for window manipulation. Click and drag window edges with modifier keys for resizing.

<a href="#">Custom sizing</a> defines exact pixel dimensions or percentages. Specify precise window sizes when default options do not match needs.

<a href="#">Center windows</a> positions windows in screen center easily. Center active window or move to center of any connected display.

<a href="#">Fill screen</a> maximizes windows without entering full-screen mode. Use available space while maintaining menu bar and dock visibility.

<a href="#">Undo functionality</a> reverses window moves when positioning goes wrong. Correct mistakes instantly without manual repositioning.
